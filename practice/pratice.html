    <div class="col">Grains:

        Grains are the foundation of a healthy and balanced diet. They are an excellent source of complex carbohydrates, which provide energy and essential nutrients to the body. Grains are also a good source of fiber, which is important for digestive health. They can be consumed in various forms such as whole grains, refined grains, and flours. Whole grains are the healthiest option as they contain all parts of the grain, including the bran, germ, and endosperm, which provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Some common whole grains include oats, brown rice, quinoa, and whole wheat. Refined grains, on the other hand, have the bran and germ removed during processing, which results in a loss of nutrients and fiber. Examples of refined grains include white bread, white rice, and pasta. Grains can be cooked in different ways such as boiling, steaming, or baking, and can be incorporated into various dishes such as soups, stews, salads, and side dishes.
